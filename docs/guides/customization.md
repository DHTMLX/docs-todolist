# Customization

## Toolbar

It is possible to customize the appearance of the toolbar. You can hide some default controls, add custom ones, and place them in the necessary order. To do that, use the [items](api/toolbar_api/configs/items_config.md) property of the Toolbar component. For instance:

<iframe src="https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/jrnestbk?mode=js" frameborder="0" class="snippet_iframe" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>
